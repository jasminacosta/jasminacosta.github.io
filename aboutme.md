### Introduction

Hello, my name is Jasmin Acosta. I earned my Bachelor's degree in English with a concentration in Literature at California State Univiserty San Bernardino, which cultivated my love for storytelling and critical analysis. I furthered my education with a Master's degree in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics at Arizona State University, where I gained expertise in leveraging data to evaluate and enhance program performance. This blend of literary insight and analytical acumen equips me with a unique skill set to approach challenges creatively and strategically.

### Professional Philosophy

I believe in the transformative power of combining analytical precision with creative thinking to solve complex problems and drive meaningful change. Analytical precision involves a meticulous approach to data collection, analysis, and interpretation, uncovering hidden patterns and deriving actionable insights. However, data alone is not enough. Creative thinking brings fresh perspectives, encouraging us to think outside the box and explore innovative solutions. By integrating these approaches, I aim to create a balanced framework that grounds decisions in solid evidence while fostering unique strategies and sustainable solutions.
