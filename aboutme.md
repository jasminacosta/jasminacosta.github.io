### Introduction

Hello, my name is Jasmin Acosta. I earned my Bachelor's degree in English with a concentration in Literature at California State Univiserty San Bernardino, which cultivated my love for storytelling and critical analysis. I furthered my education with a Master's degree in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics at Arizona State University, where I gained expertise in leveraging data to evaluate and enhance program performance. This blend of literary insight and analytical acumen equips me with a unique skill set to approach challenges creatively and strategically.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
